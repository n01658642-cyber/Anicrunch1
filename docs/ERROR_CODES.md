# Error codes

Generated from `AnililiError` by `ErrorCatalogTest`. Do not edit by hand.

Every failure the app can show carries a code. Quote it in a bug report: it is the only
thing that survives a minified release build and can be matched against a diagnostics
bundle, where the same code is the event name.

A code may carry a second half — `PLAY-02/h403`. That is the underlying library's own
error number, kept because it is more precise than anything this app invents:

| Prefix | Source |
| --- | --- |
| `h` | HTTP response status |
| `m` | Media3 `PlaybackException.errorCode` |
| `x` | Media3 `ExportException.errorCode` |
