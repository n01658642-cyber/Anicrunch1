 * Hidden resolver WebView for hanime. Not a player surface; it exists so the site's own WASM can
 * produce its rotating credentials and negotiate a stream URL.
 *
 * The caller composes this only while adult content is switched on, so a viewer who never enables
 * it does not carry a third resident WebView — which matters most on the TV sticks where memory
 * pressure already costs us the hardware decoder.

    // handshake the resolver exists to observe never ran at all.

    // an off-screen offset. Both of those were tried and neither works here: at a real size the
    // page now builds real video elements and paints frames of hanime, and on the release build
    // that came out as a thumbnail of the resolver drawn over the player. Clipping the parent is
    // the one form of hiding that Chromium's own painting cannot escape.
