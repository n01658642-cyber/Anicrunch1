     * [merged], or a refetched catalogue when [number] is past everything [merged] lists.
     *
     * A catalogue that predates the episode being asked for is a stale read, not an answer. The
     * episode lists are served stale-while-revalidate — expired copies come back instantly for a
     * week while a refresh runs behind them — so the first visit to a title after a new episode
     * airs resolves against the list from before that episode existed. No provider carries the
     * number, so the walk builds zero candidates and contacts nothing: the viewer is told "no
     * playable source on any server" in about a millisecond, while the refresh that would have
     * answered lands half a second later and repairs it only for the *next* visit. That is the
     * whole of "it said there were no servers, I pressed play again and it just worked" (reported
     * 2026-09-14 against a same-day episode; the catalogue on disk was from two days earlier).
     *
     * So spend the round trip here, where it is the difference between playing and not, rather
     * than on every entry. Both halves are asked again because either can be the stale one, and
     * the answers are merged *over* what we already had: a refresh that comes back short must not
     * cost the viewer providers the stale copy still lists. A failure keeps the old catalogue —
     * this is an attempt to do better than a stale answer, never a reason to have none.

/**
 * Which of the episode's server/audio pairs are shown in the picker. Fast providers (the Miruro
 * pipe's native HLS set and the API-backed Anivexa lookups) appear the moment the catalog has
 * them — quick and reliable, no waiting on a per-server validation round-trip. Slower scrapers
 * must be confirmed playable first so the list never advertises a dead endpoint. Anything proven
 * unavailable for this episode is always hidden, even a fast one that failed validation.
 *
 * Except that "confirmed first" and [validatesDuringPlayback] together were a deadlock. A provider
 * the sweep deliberately never runs can never be confirmed, so requiring confirmation hid it for
 * good: AllAnime and ReAnime were in the catalogue, carried the episode, and could not be picked
 * on any device — and a third source looked like a resolver failure for a whole session when it had
 * simply never been offered. Those are shown unconfirmed instead. The honesty this trades away is
 * small and bounded: they sit last, a viewer reaches one deliberately,
 * and a dead one fails over to the next server, whereas a server nobody can select is not honest
 * either.
 *
 * And a server that *did* answer once and then failed is not removed either — it is moved to the
 * end and marked [WatchSourceOption.recentlyFailed]. Dropping it is what the "servers disappear"
 * reports were: every failure puts the pair on a 1-10 minute cooldown, the cooldown is reported
 * back as unavailable on the next resolve, and the row then stayed gone for the rest of the screen
 * because this set has no expiry while the cooldown does. Leaving the screen cleared it and
 * returning re-applied whichever timers were still running, so the list a viewer came back to
 * depended on the clock. Measured across five diagnostics bundles from 2026-09-11: eighteen
 * distinct server/variant pairs hidden this way, re-applied over 218 resolves — kiwi, ally, nun,
 * kaa, animegg and animekai among them, and `ally:hsub` on its own for 36 of them. A faded row
 * that can be picked again says what happened; a missing one says the app lost the server.

 * The spine is the longest list any server offers, so one server that files two cours under the
 * first cour's id stretches it for everyone. Mushoku Tensei II is thirteen episodes on AniList;
 * AniBD lists twenty-four and RareAnimes twenty-four, so fifteen seconds after the episode opened —
 * when the slower catalog merged — eleven rows appeared with no title and the series poster in
 * place of a still, and changing server made them vanish again, since that path takes the picked
 * server's own list.
 *
 * Only for a series AniList calls FINISHED and states a count for: a releasing show's count is a
 * plan, and a server ahead of AniList on a Sunday is right where the plan is not. Never trims away
 * the episode being watched, and never returns nothing — the spine is what Next reads, so a wrong
 * trim is worse than a long list.
