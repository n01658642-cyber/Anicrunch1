 * "Download these episodes" for the detail page's episode list.
 *
 * Deliberately scoped to what the list is currently showing rather than to the season as a whole.
 * This app models One Piece as one season of over a thousand episodes, so a literal "download the
 * season" is a single tap worth hundreds of gigabytes and hours of provider requests — nothing a
 * viewer can supervise, and nothing most devices can hold. The range picker already chunks a long
 * runner into hundreds, and a filtered list is an even smaller deliberate selection; taking the
 * scope from the screen keeps "all" bounded by construction and keeps it meaning what it looks
 * like it means.
 *
 * A batch has no resolved stream to describe and no per-download destination override — where the
 * selected episodes land is whatever the viewer set in Settings, which the dialog states rather
 * than asks.
