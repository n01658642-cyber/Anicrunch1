 * the row behind would keep it in My watchlist wearing a "Completed" caption.
 *
 * Dropping it is safe for the account: both services only delete a remote entry that is still
 * PLANNING, so the unsave that follows the removal is a no-op against the status just written.

 * The local rows go for the same reason a move to a non-watching status drops them: a title the
 * account has never heard of must not be left on the watchlist or in Continue Watching, where the
 * next sync reads it as a save made on another device and pushes it straight back.
 *
 * A successful `false` means the account had no entry to remove. That is not a failure to report —
 * the viewer asked for the title to be off their list and it is — so callers close on it either way,
 * and the repository's diagnostics event is what records which of the two happened.

/**
 * Long-press menu for any poster: My List's saved cards, and the catalogue rows and grids.
 *
 * My List's cards had no long press at all, so the only way to mark a finished title Completed
 * was to open it, start an episode and use the player's list picker — the report that prompted
 * this said exactly that: the poster could be saved for later but never finished. Home, Browse and
 * Search posters then had the same hole for a viewer whose watch history lives on another service
 * and who is filling their list in from what they can find, not from what they play here.
 *
 * The destinations are the same status list Continue Watching offers (§44), so no two long-press
 * menus in the app can answer the same question differently. [kicker] only names the surface the
 * press came from.
 *
 * Deleting the entry is offered here and nowhere else, because it is not a destination: every other
 * menu in the app only ever relabels a row, and this is the one place that can take one away.
 *
 * [saveEntry] is what the device should file under "save for later" if the viewer asks for it here,
 * and it is what the detail page passes now that its own save button opens this menu instead of
 * toggling. Without it the footer can only offer the removal, which would leave a signed-out viewer
 * — or one looking at a title they have never saved — with a menu that cannot do the one thing the
 * button used to. Callers whose surface keeps its own save control pass nothing and see no change.
 *
 * [completedMarksWatched] makes Completed finish the title rather than only relabel it: the episode
 * count is filled to [totalEpisodes] as well, the way the watched eye does. The television's title
 * page passes it, because there this menu *is* the eye — without it, marking a show Completed from
 * its own page would leave the account saying episode 3 of 12.
