     * Settles what a receiver can be given before it is given anything, then switches.
     *
     * Two questions, and both used to be skipped. Whether this source can be cast *at all* —
     * [CastStreamRouting.canCastQueue] — because a keyed playlist or an embed has nothing a receiver
     * could read, and a viewer waiting out fifteen seconds of load watchdog to be told so is fifteen
     * seconds spent on an answer that was available immediately. And whether the edge proxy is
     * serving the address about to be published, because it refuses some of them and a receiver
     * handed a 500 reports only `STATE_IDLE`; see [CastStreamRouting].
     *
     * The probe costs one small ranged GET, ~150ms against a handover that already waits four to
     * five seconds for the session to connect, and it runs off the main thread with local playback
     * still going. A probe that *fails* rather than being refused leaves the proxy in place: this
     * device being unable to reach a host says nothing about what the receiver's network can do,
     * while a refusal is the proxy itself and it will refuse the receiver identically.
     *
     * When the proxy refuses a gated stream, the direct address is asked the same way before it is
     * handed over. It carries no referer from a receiver, so it is usually refused too, and saying
     * so now beats the load watchdog saying it fifteen seconds later.
