/**
 * Hands an episode to another video player installed on the device.
 *
 * This is the answer to "this stream will not play here" that does not require diagnosing why. A
 * source that defeats Media3 — an unusual codec, a container it reads badly, audio the device has no
 * decoder for — will often play in mpv or VLC, which carry their own decoders. It matters most on
 * TV, where the hardware is weakest and the ways around a bad stream are fewest.
 *
 * There is no agreed way to pass any of this. Every player invented its own extras and they do not
 * overlap, so the request carries all of the spellings at once and each player reads the ones it
 * knows; unknown extras are ignored by everyone. The spellings below are the documented ones for MX
 * Player, VLC, Just Player, Vimu, mpv-android and Nova.
 *
 * mpvNova needs no spelling of its own: it is a fork of mpv-android and its trampoline copies a
 * fixed allowlist of extras through to the real player, which already contains every mpv-android
 * name sent here — `title`, `position`, `startfrom`, `from_start`, `return_result`, `subs`,
 * `subs.name`, `subs.enable` and `subtitles_location`. Its `headers` is *not* on that list, so a
 * gated source reaches it only through the loopback proxy below; that is the path every player
 * takes anyway, so nothing is lost. Which player receives the episode is [ExternalPlayerTarget].

/**
 * The mime type to declare on the intent.
 *
 * Deliberately coarser than [com.anilili.ui.watch.videoMimeType]: that one steers Media3's own
 * extractor choice, whereas this only has to be broad enough that the target player's intent filter
 * matches. The wildcard video type is the safe answer for anything not obviously a named container,
 * because a player that declines an exact type it does not recognise never gets the chance to try.
 *
 * **The type must always be in the `video/` family, never a manifest type.** VLC routes an incoming
 * `ACTION_VIEW` on `intent.type?.startsWith("video")` alone: a `video/…` type reaches
 * `VideoPlayerActivity`, and everything else falls through to a background "open with no UI" path
 * that opens no player and reports no error. So declaring the correct `application/x-mpegURL` for
 * HLS — which is nearly every stream here — meant VLC came to the front showing its library and
 * simply never played, which is exactly what it looked like from the outside. No player needs the
 * manifest type to demux a manifest; they all sniff the stream themselves.
