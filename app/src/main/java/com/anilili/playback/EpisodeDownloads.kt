     * MPEG-TS, with the `.webp`/`.png` extension and the image content type being camouflage in

 * [parameters] with the audio track the sub/dub category asks for pinned, when [tracks] offers a
 * choice at all.
 *
 * A download keeps one audio rendition and nothing here ever said which one, so Media3 fell back to
 * whichever the manifest flags DEFAULT — the Japanese track on every multi-audio server (see
 * `ProviderCatalog.multiAudioProviders`, where sub and dub are one file rather than a stream each).
 * Playback has answered this question since those servers were added:
 * `PlayerSurface.applyCategoryAudioPreference` selects the English track once the stream publishes
 * its tracks. A download is prepared with no player, so it never did, and a dub came back Japanese.
 *
 * Offline that is worse than the same fault on a live stream: the English track was not merely left
 * unselected, it was never written to disk, so the audio menu has nothing to switch to and the
 * viewer cannot recover the dub they asked for without downloading the episode again.
 *
 * Shares [categoryAudioDecision] with the player rather than asking for a language code, because
 * these providers label the tracks ("Native", "English") far more reliably than they tag them, and
 * two rules that drifted apart would write one language into the file and have the player go
 * looking for the other.
 *
 * The viewer's standing audio-language choice is the one input the player passes and this does
 * not: it only ever ranks one dub above another, and a download has no settings to read out here.
 * So a dub is written in English where a stream carries several, which is the same track the
 * player would have chosen for anyone who never named a language.

 * Selects every text rendition in the manifest for download, and answers how many.
 *
 * Nothing here is a preference. Media3 scores text tracks the way a *player* does — a rendition
 * that matches no preferred language and carries no DEFAULT/FORCED flag scores zero and is not
 * selected — so a download prepared with only video and audio parameters emits no subtitle stream
 * keys at all, and the segments are never written to the cache. That is why soft-sub servers whose
 * subtitles ride inside the HLS manifest, rather than arriving as sidecar VTT URLs in
 * `sources.subtitles`, downloaded as raw unsubtitled video: the sidecar path had nothing to fetch
 * and the track path never asked. The audio selection right above this has carried a comment about
 * exactly this hazard ("if it is unselected, it was never written to disk") since it was written;
 * text simply never got the same treatment.
 *
 * A download is one-shot and text renditions are tiny next to video, so every track is taken rather
 * than the best-scoring one. Narrowing here would make the offline subtitle menu smaller than the
 * live one for no saving worth having.
 *
 * Each track goes in as its own additive selection because [DownloadHelper.replaceTrackSelections]
 * resolves one selection per renderer, and there is a single text renderer: asking for all of them
 * in one parameters object would still yield one track.
 *
 * Capability is deliberately not required ([Tracks.Group.isTrackSupported] is asked with
 * `allowExceedsCapabilities`). A device that cannot render a track still exports it — the flattened
 * VTT sidecar beside the MP4 is read by whatever plays it next, not by this device's decoders.
