/**
 * Merge the account's Plan-to-watch list into this device's saves, in both directions.
 *
 * This used to be additive only, which left the Saved list half-synced: adding a title reached
 * every device, removing one reached the account and stopped there. Unsave on the phone and the
 * television kept offering it forever, with no way to clear it but unsaving again on each device.
 *
 * A save is dropped only when the account **used** to know the title and now does not know it under
 * any status at all — [previousRemoteIds] minus [knownRemoteIds]. That is the one signal that
 * genuinely means "removed somewhere else", and phrasing it as a disappearance rather than an
 * absence is what makes the dangerous cases safe:
 *
 * - A save made while signed out has never appeared in a remote snapshot, so it can never be
 *   dropped — it survives until the push that carries it up.
 * - The first refresh after a fresh install or login has an empty [previousRemoteIds], so it can
 *   only add.
 * - Catalogue-native hanime ids are never on the account at all, so they are never removable.
 * - A title merely *moved* elsewhere (Planning to Watching) is still known, so the heart stays
 *   filled rather than silently clearing on a title the viewer never unsaved.
 *
 * [knownRemoteIds] covers every status, not just Planning, and an empty one is treated as no
 * information rather than as an empty account: a partial or degraded fetch must never be read as
 * "the viewer deleted everything".
