     * therefore has no track of its own to publish. Rather than leave a viewer to hunt through the
     * OpenSubtitles panel on every episode, the tracks are borrowed from the provider best placed
     * to lend them: AniChan is keyed on the same AniList id, so this needs no title matching and
     * cannot fetch a different show's subtitles; it publishes ten languages, so the existing
     * preferred-language setting still has something to choose from; and its tracks were measured
     * needing no headers, so they load beside a stream from another origin.
     *
     * Borrowing timings across encodes is only defensible because it was measured. Across 22
     * episodes of two shows, AniChan's Crunchyroll-sourced cues against the text burned into
     * XFDM's picture gave 32 confident offsets with a median of +0.25s, all inside ±1.5s, and no
     * drift within an episode — both sides cut from the same broadcast master. That is why
     * [SourcesResult.subtitleOffsetMs] is left at zero here rather than seeded with a guess;
     * [com.anilili.playback.SubtitleDelay] remains the way out of the cases nobody measured.
     *
     * A failure is swallowed deliberately. AniChan not having the episode is not a reason to fail a
     * stream that plays perfectly well with the subtitles the site burned in, and the viewer can
     * still attach a file by hand.
     *
     * **Not called during a resolve.** With XFDM's own streams now precomputed, this pair of
     * requests was the only thing left between pressing play and a picture — 589ms of a 589ms
     * resolve. The view model asks for it once playback is already running and merges the tracks
     * in, which `PlayerSurface` handles as an ordinary subtitle-only re-prepare. The first line of
     * dialogue in the episode this was measured against is at 29.5s, so nothing is missed.
     *
     * The answer is cached because a binge asks for the same thing on every episode and a rewatch
     * asks again tomorrow. The TTL is deliberately shorter than the tracks' own life: AniChan
     * stamps them with a fixed expiry date rather than a rolling one, so a long cache would
     * eventually hand out URLs that had already lapsed.
