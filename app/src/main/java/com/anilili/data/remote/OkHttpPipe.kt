 * Miruro's own "I do not have that episode in that variant".

 * Not a Cloudflare refusal — those are 403 and 503, and they carry `cf-mitigated`. This one is the

 * its "lost clearance" set: no amount of re-clearing changes it.

 * Whether the remaining mirrors could still answer differently from the one that just refused.
 *
 * They cannot for a 444: all four origins serve the same catalogue, so a "not this episode or
 * variant" is the same answer four times over. Measured across six diagnostics bundles on
 * 2026-09-10 — 20 per-origin refusals in five walks, every walk a complete set of four, never once
 * a mirror disagreeing — and the cost of asking anyway was 1.5s on a phone and **20s** on an armv7
 * television, in front of a fallback the resolver already had ready.
 *
 * Anything else keeps walking. A 403 or 503 is the zone re-hardening on one edge and another may
 * still be open, which is the whole reason there are four.

/**
 * The pipe over a plain HTTP client, with no browser engine anywhere.
 *
 * For most of this project's history that was impossible: the secure API paths answered
 * Cloudflare's block page to anything that was not a same-origin fetch inside a cleared page,
 * which is the entire reason GeckoView was taken on — and with it about 85 MB of a 97 MB APK.
 *
 * (Editors: no literal slash-star anywhere in this KDoc. Kotlin nests block comments, so writing
 * a path like that one out opens a comment that the "star-slash-star" Accept header below then
 * closes, and the rest of the file parses as garbage. Same note as [PipeBridge]'s.)
 *
 * Measured on 2026-09-10 from the S25 on home Wi-Fi, the zone no longer does this. All four
 * mirrors served the real site with **no challenge at all** — no interstitial, no `cf_clearance`
 * issued, no `cf_chl_rc_ni` retry marker — and this exact request returned `200`,
 * `cf-mitigated` absent, with a 3.87 MB gzip payload, on every one of `.to`, `.tv`, `.bz` and
 * `.ru`, holding no cookie whatsoever. That directly contradicts §0.18 and §0.21's own no-cookie
 * control, which answered `403 challenge` on 2026-09-09: the zone changed, not the client.
 *
 * So this is a **trial**, and its assumption is the zone's posture, which is the one thing here
 * that has always moved. If Cloudflare tightens again this returns 403 and the Miruro providers go
 * with it; the native scrapers are untouched either way. Keep the header set below exactly as it
 * is — §0.21 established that the block is a header-shape rule, so a missing `Referer` or
 * `Sec-Fetch-*` is enough to be refused even when the zone is otherwise open.
 *
 * The reply is deliberately the same JSON string [PipeBridge.fetch] has always returned, so
 * `PipeClient` and its decoder are untouched: `{ok,status,obf,body}`, where `obf` is the
 * `x-obfuscated` response header the decoder keys off.
