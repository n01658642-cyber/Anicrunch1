/**
 * Replays a Cloudflare clearance on every provider request, and earns one when a host starts
 * challenging.
 *
 * Modelled on CloudStream's `CloudflareKiller`, with two deliberate differences. It only treats a
 * response as a challenge when the body or the `cf-mitigated` header says so — a 403 from a
 * Cloudflare-fronted origin is far more often a hotlink or geo block, and popping a dialog at
 * someone for one of those asks them to solve a puzzle that cannot help. And the clearance it earns
 * is persisted by [CloudflareClearanceStore] rather than being thrown away with the process, so the
 * challenge appears once rather than once per launch.
 *
 * **Bounded wait.** The provider client caps a call at 15 seconds and the catalogue gives each
 * provider its own 15-second lane, and neither can be extended from inside an interceptor. So the
 * request that triggers a challenge waits only [SOLVE_WAIT_MS] for the answer and then gives up on
 * itself — but *only on itself*. The challenge stays on screen for as long as the viewer needs, and
 * the clearance it earns lands in the store for the retry, for the other providers still resolving,
 * and for every request after that. Someone who takes their time over the checkbox loses the one
 * request that opened the dialog, not the session.
