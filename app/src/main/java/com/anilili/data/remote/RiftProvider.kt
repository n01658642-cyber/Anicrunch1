/**
 * AnimeRift (`com.riftapps.animerift`), the Arabic catalogue behind the Anime Rift Android app.
 *
 * Not a website: it is a private mobile API reached through Firebase, and it is the only Arabic
 * server in this app. Measured 2026-10-06 — current-season titles carry Arabic subtitles at 1080p
 * from episode 1 (11 of 14 sources on three of them), several also carry an Arabic dub, and its
 * episode rows publish intro/outro windows on 1164 of One Piece's 1180 episodes.
 *
 * ```
 * POST firebaseinstallations.googleapis.com/v1/projects/anime-rift-4142e/installations   -> fid
 * POST firebaseremoteconfig.googleapis.com/v1/projects/536921039715/namespaces/firebase:fetch
 *                                                                         -> the gateway base URL
 * POST {gateway}/auth/register/device                                     -> a bound device
 * POST {gateway}/library/search?page=0&sort_by=release_year&…            -> title candidates
 * GET  {gateway}/library/episodes/{id}?sort_by_latest=1&with_arcs=true&with_favorites=true
 * POST {gateway}/library/episode/sources          {animeId, episodeId, episode_number}
 * POST {gateway}/library/episode/source/can_play  {episodeId, hostId, …}     -> sessionId
 * POST {gateway}/library/episode/source/direct_link {id, quality, with_internal_player, sessionId}
 * ```
 *
 * Four things differ from the CloudStream extension this was ported from, each because it was
 * measured against the live gateway rather than read off the decompile:
 *
 * 1. **The gateway URL is resolved at runtime.** The extension hardcodes
 *    `gateway.anime-rift.com`; remote config now answers `gateway.embrassme.top/api/v4`, so the
 *    hardcoded host no longer serves the paths this client calls.
 * 2. **No `integrity` JWT.** The extension signs an HS256 token per endpoint with a 64-hex secret
 *    baked into the build. The gateway does not check it: a garbage token, a token signed for the
 *    wrong scope, and no `integrity` header at all were each answered `200`, including on
 *    `/auth/register/device`. Omitting it keeps a leaked credential out of this app for nothing.
 * 3. **No `/ads_manager/claim`.** The extension calls it with `reward_result:"not_filled"` and
 *    `is_reward:true` — asserting a reward ad was watched when it was not. A device that had never
 *    touched the ads endpoint was answered `claimed:false` by `can_play` and still received a
 *    working stream with the claim skipped, so the call buys nothing.
 * 4. **Hosts are ordered by the priority the service publishes**, not by the list in the client.
 *
 * The `fid` and the registered device are kept in preferences rather than minted per run: Firebase
 * hands out a new installation for every call with an empty `fid`, and every registration leaves a
 * device behind on their side, so re-bootstrapping on each launch would be both wasteful and
 * conspicuous. [rebuild] covers the case where the device is refused anyway.

     * `["cr2", "rift-streamer", "streamtape"]` disagrees with it in the middle — the service ranks

     * A host whose key is absent from `configs` sorts last. Then the best quality a host offers,
     * which puts the 1080p rows ahead of the 240p ones for the same server.

     * Ahead of both: a host that answers with a ticket ([TICKET_HOSTS]) goes after every other,

     * but a streamtape resolve costs a 5s wait and, from the app, a Cloudflare refusal — ranked by
     * the service alone it was reached before rift-streamer and spent the whole source budget.
     *
     * `wanted` is one of Rift's own tags — `ar_sub` or `ar_dub`. Arabic only: this provider exists
     * to be the Arabic server, and the `en_*` and `it_*` rows beside it are the same catalogue under
