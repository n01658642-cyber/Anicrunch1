/**
 * Persisted progress delivery for whichever list service is signed in.
 *
 * Playback only has to enqueue the target episode. WorkManager retains it across navigation,
 * process death, and temporary loss of connectivity. Updates for one title form a serial chain;
 * both services refuse a progress regression, which makes out-of-order or repeated playback
 * harmless.
 *
 * MAL was delivered this way from the start. AniList was not: it posted straight from
 * viewModelScope, so leaving the player at the 80% mark cancelled the mutation mid-flight, and a
 * timeout or a 429 — a quota this app is already known to run close to — dropped the episode with
 * nothing but a diagnostics line. Nothing retried it, and nothing ever would: the account's count
 * only moves on the *next* episode, so a single lost push left that episode unrecorded on every
 * other device. AniList is the more popular login here and had the weaker path.
 *
 * The service is read when the work runs rather than when it is queued, so an update outlives the
 * screen that asked for it and still goes to the account the viewer is actually signed into.
